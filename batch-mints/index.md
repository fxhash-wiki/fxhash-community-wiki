The following projects are known batch mints which result in similar - if not identical - results, defeating the point and purpose for the fxhash() generative function. Please beware of purchasing the following, and be aware that whilst they still are deterministed based on the hash, they are not 'unique' in the same way other editions of the same gtk may be.
